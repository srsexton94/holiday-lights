# Holiday Twinkle Lights
This project is designed as a "twinkle lights" UI, where the user can select a mid-winter holiday of their choice (or Rainbow!) and start/stop a holiday "twinkle light" display.
Inspired/modified from [Florinpop17 / App Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Christmas-Lights-App.md)

## Dependencies
* [GA Browser Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template) - webpack for `require` system, build pipeline, and development server.
  - includes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) and [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install`

## Future Goals
In my next edition of this project I would like to...
* Debug the issue where one of the diwali colors is changing the size of the 'light' (circle div)
* Debug the issue where 'light' elements later in the display (bottom right hand corner) don't seem to change as frequently (or at all) after the initial play.
* Reintroduce abandoned feature where the user can choose/adjust the size of the display (was running into sizing issues with the container element)
* perhaps add varying intensities for the display lights? (as suggested in florinpop17 doc)
